This module covers necessary steps to deploy the infrastructure required to run this lab.


=== Clone this repository

[source, bash]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:rprakashg-rh/microshift-workshop.git
----

=== Provision AWS VPC
We will use terraform scripts to provision an AWS VPC infrastructure to deploy 
infrastructure required to complete this lab. These steps could probably be part 
of provisioning lab environments.

Open a new terminal windows and switch to the directory where you cloned this 
repository then run commands below to provision the VPC infrastructure.

[source, bash]
----
$ cd terraform/vpc
terraform init 
terraform plan
terraform apply
----

=== Provision an EC2 instance running RHEL 9.4 
Microshift 4.16 through 4.18 versions require a RHEL 9.4 instance. Ansible playbook
is made available to automate the provisioning on EC2 instance. Before we can execute
the playbook we need to perform below steps

==== Update Ansible Vars file
Ansible uses vars file to define dynamic aspects of the system. A sample vars file
is provided. Contents of the yaml file are shown below. We will need to update the
values for ami, subnet_id and security_group_id.

[source, yaml]
----
---
ami: ami-0dc921650a088ecb2
instance_name: microshift-412
instance_type: t2.2xlarge
key_name: ec2
subnet_id: subnet-0ddef3ec4ea452aac
security_group_id: sg-0fdc37bb13959088b
storage: 50
commands: []
...
----

===== Update ami value
First lets get the RHEL 9.4 AMI ID for the region we want to provision the EC2 instance by running the command below.

[source, bash]
----
$  aws ec2 describe-images \
  --owners 309956199498 \
  --region <AWS region> \
  --filters "Name=name,Values=RHEL-9.4*" "Name=state,Values=available" \
  --query 'sort_by(Images, &CreationDate)[-1].ImageId' \
  --output text
----

Above script will display an AMI ID as shown in screen capture below. 

image::find-ami-output.jpg[amiid]

Copy the `AMI ID`and update the ansible vars file 

===== Update public subnet id
Login to AWS console to find the public subnet id. See screen capture below.

image::find-aws-public-subnet-id.jpg[subnet]

===== Update public subnet security group id
Login to AWS console to find the security group id for public subnets on AWS as 
shown in screen capture below

image::find-aws-sg-id.jpg[securitygroup]

===== Create an ansible vault
We are going to use ansible vault to store some sensitive secrets we need to 
provision the ec2 instance. Structure of the yaml in ansible vault file looks like below

[source,yaml]
----
admin_user: ec2-user
ssh_key: <paste ssh public key here>
admin_user_password: <redacted>
----

Create the ansible vault by running the command below and paste the yaml snippet
shown above and replace values to match your environment and save and exist.

[source,yaml]
----
$ ansible-vault create vars/secrets.yml
----

==== Provisioning EC2 instance
At this point we are now ready to provision the EC2 instance. Run the ansible playbook
as shown below.

[source,yaml]
----
$ ansible-playbook --vault-password-file <(echo "$VAULT_SECRET") launch-ec2.yaml -e @vars/ec2.yml
----

If everything went through successfully we should see an output like below.

=== Connect the Instance to Red Hat Cloud
Next we will need to connect the instance to Red Hat. We will SSH into the instance and 
use `rhc` cli tool to connect the system to Red Hat cloud.

SSH into the instance
[source,bash]
----
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/ec2 ec2-user@ec2-52-12-123-175.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
----

Screen capture below shows successfully SSH'd into the instance.

image::ssh-output.jpg[ssh]

Connect the system to Red Hat cloud using `rhc` cli command shown below. Command will
prompt to enter your redhat credentials, once successfully authenticated system will be
connected to Red Hat cloud.

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo rhc connect
----

=== Check for pending updates and update the system
Next we will check for any pending updates to rpm packages and update the system.

Check for pending updates by running command below

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo dnf check-update
----

Upgrade all packages and dependencies by running the command below
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo dnf upgrade
----
